This is a temporary and simplified tempest setup and run that uses internal Red
Hat tools. Please disregard it, it will be removed soon.

If you want to use it anyway, you will need to be on the Red Hat network and
remove the tags "tempest_setup,tempest_run" from your ansible configuration.
Replace them with the tag "tempest_rhosqe". Requires that tempest is running
from the controller node.
